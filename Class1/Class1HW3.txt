A rental car company claims the mean time to rent a car on their website is 60 (xbar) seconds with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. A random sample of 36 customers attempted to rent a car on the website. 

1) If the mean time to rent was 65 (mu) seconds. Is this enough evidence to contradict the company's claim at 5% confidence level? What's the power?
H0: mu = 60
H1: mu != 60
2) If the analysts team believe the claim is not correct and the the time for rent is 67 (mu) seconds, what's the sample size need to designed for a sufficient test with 85% of power
H0: mu = 60
H1: mu > 60
We get a new mean claim, and try to use it to reject the original claim, mu = 60.
